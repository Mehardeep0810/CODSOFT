This is Task-4: Ecommerce Website the final task of the UI/UX Design Virtual Internship at Codsoft.
As suggested in the pdf my design is:
(i) Visually appealing
(ii) Easy to use
(iii) Categorized
(iv) Searchable
I have used Figma to complete all the 4 tasks. I have created 4 folders named "Task-1, Task-2, Task-3 and Task-4".
Each folder has a Video and Screenshot of the design and the working of it.
